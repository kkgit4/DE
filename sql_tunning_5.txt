5. List the names of students who have taken a course from department v6 (deptId), but not v7.

No need to mention v7 details while fetching only records for v6. And rewrite the query with CTE




Solution
--------
WITH tra_course AS 
(SELECT studId FROM Transcript
INNER JOIN Course 
ON deptId = @v6 AND Course.crsCode = Transcript.crsCode)

SELECT * FROM student s
INNER JOIN tra_course t 
ON s.id = t.studid





Below query giving 26 rows instead 30
------------------------------------
SELECT * FROM student 
WHERE id IN 
(SELECT studId FROM Transcript
INNER JOIN Course 
ON deptId = @v6 AND Course.crsCode = Transcript.crsCode)
