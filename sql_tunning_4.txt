4. List the names of students who have taken course v4 (crsCode).

Don't have match for semester in Transcript table, so no records returned
To get the names of stundents irrespective of semesters, need to remove condition on Transcript table 




Solution
--------
SELECT name FROM Student,
	(SELECT studId FROM Transcript,
		(SELECT crsCode, semester FROM Professor
			JOIN Teaching
			WHERE Professor.name = 'Amber Hill' AND Professor.id = Teaching.profId) as alias1
	WHERE Transcript.crsCode = alias1.crsCode ) as alias2
WHERE Student.id = alias2.studId;
