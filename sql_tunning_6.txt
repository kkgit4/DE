6. List the names of students who have taken all courses offered by department v8 (deptId).

Having condition with COUNT not required here, as we are fetching stundent name who have taken course, not doing any aggregation to use HAVING 
Also observed that, no joining required with teaching table 



Solution
--------
SELECT name FROM Student,
	(SELECT studId
	FROM Transcript
		WHERE crsCode IN
		(SELECT crsCode FROM Course WHERE deptId = @v8 AND crsCode IN (SELECT crsCode FROM Teaching))
		GROUP BY studId
		-- HAVING COUNT(*) = 
-- 			(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Course WHERE deptId = @v8 AND crsCode IN (SELECT crsCode FROM Teaching))
) as alias
WHERE id = alias.studId;



OR
---------------------------

WITH tra_course AS 
(SELECT studId FROM Transcript
INNER JOIN Course 
INNER JOIN teaching
ON deptId = @v8 
AND Course.crsCode = Transcript.crsCode
AND Course.crsCode = teaching.crsCode)

SELECT * FROM student s
INNER JOIN tra_course t 
ON s.id = t.studid
